                <p>If you are a US resident of voting age, youâ€™ve certainly heard people complain about the perceived un-impactfulness of their vote. We have created a tool which allows anyone to follow a vote from the start of the caucuses and primaries, up until the general election. Play around with it, and then make up your own mind as to whether your vote really is as un-impactful as it may seem.</p>

                <p>Of course your vote can only be meaningful if you are legally able to in the first place. If you are above the age of 18 and are not currently a registered voter, please do so!</p>

                <p>As is with the complicate democratic process the US uses, every state conducts their delegate-allotment processes slightly differently. Thus, we need to know which state you are currently from before we proceed.</p>
